			<p>What are the main causes for PC errors and performance related issues? These errors can occur from a variety of reasons, including incomplete program installations or failure to uninstall properly. Spyware, malware, system conflicts, hardware failure, ActiveX  and registry errors only add to the problem. The Windows registry becomes problematic due to the constant writing, modifying and erasing of information from your computer's registry causing a never ending source of errors. .</p>
			<p>With time, conflicts and errors can appear because of a buildup of registry entries as well as partially or fully corrupted. Missing or deleted file associations only add to the problem. Malware and spyware programs can also wreak havoc by making unwanted changes on your computer, which leads to the errors and reduced PC performance you are likely experiencing. Sometimes, registry errors can be ongoing in the background without you noticing. These are still dangerous if left unchecked and should be repaired regularly. Some of the annoyances can include:</p>
